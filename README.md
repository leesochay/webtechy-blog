The importance of technology blogs cannot be overlooked as they can enhance the understanding of the less experienced developers to seasoned veterans. These blogs can fulfill these learning enhancements whether by reading them or contributing to writing blogposts and commenting on published blogposts.

This project and challenge is to build a blog site where future and current developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other posts as well. This project utilizes the Model-View-Controller (MVC) structure, utilizing handlebars for the viewing templates , sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.

This is my attempt to fulfill the acceptance criteria for the blog site. While some functionality needs improvement, this project, while very challenging, brought about great learning outcomes.
